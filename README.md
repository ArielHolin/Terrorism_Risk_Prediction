# Terrorism_Risk_Prediction
Final Project at ITC - Terrorism risk prediction for law enforcement organizations is an evaluation tool for prevention prioritization, based on intelligence gatherable prior to the event. The model was trained in the project using information regarding over 180k terror attacks spanning over 40 years.

The jupyter notebook is for reading only (unable to run the cells), since the data file being used is too large to upload here.

In addition, you can find a full pdf report explaining the project.
